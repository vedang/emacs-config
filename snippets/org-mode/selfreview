** Rough Notes: Things that I have accomplished, $2

This is an unsorted list of things that I have done in the last six months. It is built by looking at all my status updates and all the feedback I have captured in 1:1 meetings and peer interactions. This is the rough material I will use to write my performance review. Once I have this list, I will sort the items into themes and impact and fill out my performance review above. Once that is complete, I will rewrite / copy the content into whatever format the current review system needs.

** $1's Performance Review, $2
This is where I write the actual performance review, which is then exported / reformatted for the appropriate HR tool.

*** What were my goals for the 6 months?

*** What projects did I work on?
Organize so that high impact work comes first. Make sure to highlight who the stakeholders were and what the impact of the project was for the company. How did the stakeholders benefit? For each project:

**** What was my contribution to the project?

**** What was the result of the project?
(Only if enough time has passed and results are observable)

**** What are the lessons learnt from this project?
What could have gone better?

*** How did I improve the performance of / mentor my team?
Capture initiatives run for improving the performance of the team, any challenging situations that were faced and what the course of action was in those situations. The definition of team here is loose. This also encompasses any cross-team efforts or org-wide efforts at improving process / outcomes.

**** What initiatives have not panned out / could not be completed / did not get enough attention?
Why? Do I have a plan to change that?

*** How have I grown personally?

**** What new things did I learn?
Is the knowledge useful / applicable to others and did I take efforts to propagate that knowledge? How?

**** What areas have I not made progress on, but should have?
These are things I know I should do, or I want to do, but I don't make time for. Why?
